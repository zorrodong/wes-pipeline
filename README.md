# Whole-exome sequencing workflow

This repository contains custom code and scripts developed for variant discovery from whole-exome sequencing (WES) data, and has been developed as part of my PhD thesis.

##Overview

This is a workflow for the annotation and discovery of SNVs/indels from WES data. It is optimised for when samples have been sequenced in multiple batches or using different exome enrichment kits.
